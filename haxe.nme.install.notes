Don't use distribuition repos since they are old.

Instead follow instruction from the haxe site

For Wheezy:
----------

Need to compile from source due to glibc incompatabilities.

From the repo follow instruction, boiled down to this:
1. Get repos
git clone --recursive git://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe.git

2. Install OCAML
http://ocaml.org/docs/install.html#Debian

3. Build and install
make
su -c "make install"
